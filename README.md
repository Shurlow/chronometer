# Chronometer (Sundial)

Turn your desktop background into a clock, like a sundial. Choose two colors and let Chronometer cycle between the color gradients throughout the day.

### Build

Chronometer uses ImageMagick to create gradient images so running the development build requires ImageMagick installed.

To run the electron app:
```
npm i
npm start
```
